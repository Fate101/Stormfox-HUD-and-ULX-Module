# StormFox 1 & 2 Hud
This is for Garry's Mod and the StormFox 1/2 Addon. This adds a simple clock to your hud reflecting the StormFox time.

Simply install the folder to garrysmod/addons. Ensure the folder is lowercase as it may cause issues on Linux based servers.

The can **only** be changed by the server and they update in real time. You will need to put these into your **autoexec.cfg** or **server.cfg**
## Upcoming Features

 - Garry's Mod Workshop Release.
 - Format all variables under clock such as Server Name/Weather/Temp to allow users to choose which order these are in as well as enable/disable them.
 - Allow server admins to set the position of the hud via ConVars (Workshop release only - If they don't want to modify the code themselves)
